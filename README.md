This is a weather app that allows you to search by city. Search for any city and that days weather stats will appear in the first box. In that box you'll find various data, as well as a severity indicator with the UV index. As you search for cities, they appear in the recent history box below the search bar. The links will also bring back the weather stats when clicked.
